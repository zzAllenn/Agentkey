**Install AgentKey. Give your AI superpowers.**

AgentKey is the master key for the agent ecosystem. When using Claude, Manus, or other agents, you often need external data: social media, e-commerce, on-chain data, various APIs. That means hunting down API keys, managing subscriptions, or hitting dead ends.

With AgentKey installed, your agent gains all these data capabilities automatically. No per-provider registrations, no juggling separate API bills. One subscription and go.

## Use Cases

| You ask your agent to...                               | Without AgentKey              | With AgentKey                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 🐦 What has Musk been saying on Twitter lately?        | Can't access, tweets blocked  | Pulls all relevant tweets and summarizes them  |
| 📕 What do people think of this product on Instagram?  | Blocked, login required       | Scrapes real posts, organizes by sentiment     |
| 📺 What does this YouTube / Bilibili video cover?      | Can't read, no subtitles      | Reads the video/transcript, extracts key points |
| 📖 Find Reddit threads about this pain point           | 403 blocked                   | Finds relevant threads and extracts solutions  |
| 👔 Check this competitor / candidate's LinkedIn        | 403, access issues            | Opens the page, summarizes key info            |
| 🎵 What's trending on Douyin / TikTok right now?       | Can't scrape the hot list     | Pulls trending topics and tags                 |
| 🌐 What does this webpage say?                         | Returns a wall of raw HTML    | Extracts the content, explains it clearly      |
| 📦 What does this GitHub repo do?                      | Have to click through yourself | Reads README & Issues, one-line summary       |
| 🧾 What has this wallet / fund been buying lately?     | Click through a block explorer | Summarizes recent transactions and positions  |

Before AgentKey: 10 tasks → 10 API keys → 10 separate bills.

Your agent is half-capable at best, constantly needing human help to find data, juggling credentials, drowning in complexity.

Now: one AgentKey handles everything. **AgentKey unifies all the external access your AI needs to do real work.**

## New here? Start on the web

Before touching the terminal, you can get a feel for AgentKey directly in your browser — the website and console explain things more visually than this README can.

- 🌐 **[agentkey.app](https://agentkey.app)** — Product overview, supported platforms, live demos, pricing details
- 🎛️ **[console.agentkey.app](https://console.agentkey.app)** — Sign up, manage your subscription, manage your API key, track usage

The one-line install below is what plugs AgentKey into your AI agent. If you only want to look around first, the two links above are the friendlier starting point.

---

## Install

One command. A browser tab opens for login, then you're done. The installer auto-detects every agent on your machine ([40+ supported](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills#available-agents). Common examples include Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, and Cursor CLI, etc.) and configures each one.

**macOS / Linux**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://agentkey.app/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows** (PowerShell)
```powershell
irm https://agentkey.app/install.ps1 | iex
```

Restart your agent, then ask it something that needs the internet:

> *"What has Musk been tweeting about lately?"*

That's it. No API key to copy, no JSON to edit.

## What your agent can now do

AgentKey maintains cloud-side integrations across the open web — no extra accounts, no extra keys.

| Capability | What it covers |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Web search** | Search engines, news, and real-time discovery across the open web |
| **Web scraping** | Clean article extraction, structured data, and metadata from any URL |
| **On-chain / Crypto** | Token prices, market data, on-chain activity, and project metadata |
| **Social & content** | Public posts, videos, and discussions across major social and content platforms |
| **Finance** | Stock & FX quotes, technical indicators, company financials, and earnings |
| **E-commerce** | Product listings, prices, reviews, and best-sellers across major marketplaces |
| **Business** | Company, funding, investor, and people data for market and competitive research |

Underlying providers are routed automatically and grow over time — your agent can call `find_tools` to see what's currently available.

**Planned:** Maps & Weather

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>Is it safe?</b></summary>

Yes. AgentKey is a master key — one platform that unlocks external capabilities for your agent. By design, we have no access to your local files, your credentials, or your agent's conversations. The only data AgentKey collects is anonymous usage telemetry — which agent you installed into, your skill version, and upgrade outcomes — never your queries or responses. See "How do I opt out of telemetry?" below.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How is this different from Claude / ChatGPT's built-in web access?</b></summary>

Native web access in Claude and ChatGPT has limited platform coverage. It often can't reach Twitter, on-chain data, etc. AgentKey fills those gaps.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How does pricing work? What if I use up my plan's credits?</b></summary>

AgentKey is subscription-based. Each plan includes a monthly credit allowance; usage beyond that is billed pay-as-you-go as overage. You can upgrade your plan or manage billing anytime at [console.agentkey.app](https://console.agentkey.app). See [agentkey.app](https://agentkey.app) for current plans and pricing.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How do I update?</b></summary>

There are two pieces and they update differently:

- **MCP server**: the real server is hosted at `https://api.agentkey.app/v1/mcp`, so it's always up to date — no local upgrade step. The `@agentkey/cli` package (run as `npx -y @agentkey/cli --auth-login`) only writes the remote-HTTP MCP config into each AI client and never has to be re-run unless you want to rotate your key.

- **Skill files** (`SKILL.md` + helpers): how this updates depends on your client.

### Claude Code

Updates are automatic. On the first call of a session the skill runs a silent version check; if a new release is available it prompts you to upgrade and (with your consent) runs `npx skills update -g agentkey`.

### Claude Desktop, Cursor, and other clients without an inline Bash tool

The skill cannot run the inline check itself, but starting in v1.4.0 the **MCP server publishes the latest skill version via a dedicated metadata tool (`agentkey_skill_meta`)**. Your agent calls it once per session, compares against this skill's own version, and prompts you to upgrade with the exact command for your client. See [protocol/skill-meta-v1.md](./protocol/skill-meta-v1.md) for the protocol details.

**One-time bootstrap on Desktop:** if you're stuck on a pre-1.4.0 skill in Claude Desktop, the metadata tool exists but your skill rule doesn't know how to read it. Bring yourself current once with:

```bash
# Replace <UUID1>/<UUID2> with the actual session folder under skills-plugin
# (usually there's just one; pick the one that contains skills/agentkey/SKILL.md)
DESKTOP_BASE="$HOME/Library/Application Support/Claude/local-agent-mode-sessions/skills-plugin"
LATEST_REPO_ZIP=$(mktemp -d)/agentkey.tar.gz
curl -fsSL https://github.com/chainbase-labs/agentkey/archive/refs/heads/main.tar.gz -o "$LATEST_REPO_ZIP"
tar -xzf "$LATEST_REPO_ZIP" -C "$(dirname "$LATEST_REPO_ZIP")"
find "$DESKTOP_BASE" -type d -path "*/skills/agentkey" 2>/dev/null | while read -r dst; do
  cp -R "$(dirname "$LATEST_REPO_ZIP")"/agentkey-main/skills/agentkey/. "$dst/"
done
# Then fully quit and restart Claude Desktop.
```

After this one bootstrap, future versions will be discovered automatically via the metadata tool.

### Force manual update (any client)

```bash
# Refresh the skill content
npx skills update agentkey

# Pin a specific version
npx skills add chainbase-labs/agentkey@v1.0.0
```

Note: `npx skills update` writes to `~/.agents/skills/agentkey` and `~/.claude/skills/agentkey`, which is where Claude Code reads from. **Claude Desktop reads from its own sandbox path** and is not touched by `npx skills update` — use the Desktop bootstrap command above for Desktop.

Re-run `npx -y @agentkey/cli --auth-login` only when you want to rotate your API key.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How do I uninstall?</b></summary>

One command, cleans every agent and config file.

**macOS / Linux**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://agentkey.app/uninstall.sh | bash
```

**Windows** (PowerShell)
```powershell
irm https://agentkey.app/uninstall.ps1 | iex
```

Removes the skill from every agent, strips the `agentkey` MCP entry + API key from all MCP client configs, and clears caches/logs. Pass `--keep-marketplace` (bash) / `-KeepMarketplace` (PowerShell) to retain the Claude Code plugin marketplace entry.

**Prefer manual two-step?**

```bash
# 1. Remove the skill from every agent
npx skills remove chainbase-labs/agentkey

# 2. Delete the "agentkey" entry under mcpServers in each MCP client config:
#    - Claude Code:     ~/.claude.json
#    - Claude Desktop:  ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json  (macOS)
#                       %APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json                      (Windows)
#    - Cursor:          ~/.cursor/mcp.json
```

The one-command uninstaller additionally cleans npm/npx caches, legacy shell rc entries, CLAUDE.md sections, and MCP stdio logs — use that if you want a fully clean slate.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How do I opt out of telemetry?</b></summary>

AgentKey sends anonymous usage telemetry (which agent you use, skill version, upgrade outcomes — never queries or responses). Three ways to opt out, any of them works:

```bash
# Persistent opt-out (recommended)
touch ~/.config/agentkey/telemetry-disabled

# One-shot env override (CI / single session)
AGENTKEY_TELEMETRY=0 <your command>

# At install time
curl -fsSL https://agentkey.app/install.sh | bash -s -- --no-telemetry
```

To re-enable, delete `~/.config/agentkey/telemetry-disabled`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Something's not working — how do I check?</b></summary>

Inside your agent, try `/agentkey status` — it diagnoses your MCP config, version, and connectivity.

Available slash commands:

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/agentkey` | Auto-triggered during data queries — you usually don't call it manually |
| `/agentkey setup` | First-time setup: configure API key + verify MCP connectivity |
| `/agentkey status` | Diagnose current config (MCP, version, connectivity test) |

Still stuck? See the "Where do I get help" item below.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Advanced install options (CI / specific agents / manual two-step)</b></summary>

The installer auto-detects which AI agents you have on this machine (by probing well-known config dirs and binaries from the [vercel-labs/skills supported-agents list](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills)) and pre-selects them — no multi-select prompt. Override with the flags below.

**Installer flags:**

```bash
# Non-interactive (CI / unattended): install to every detected agent, no prompts
curl -fsSL https://agentkey.app/install.sh | bash -s -- --yes

# See which agents the installer would auto-select on this host (and exit)
curl -fsSL https://agentkey.app/install.sh | bash -s -- --list-agents

# Only install the skill for specific agents (overrides auto-detection)
curl -fsSL https://agentkey.app/install.sh | bash -s -- --only claude-code,cursor

# Skip our agent detection; let `skills` CLI install for every agent it finds
curl -fsSL https://agentkey.app/install.sh | bash -s -- --all-agents

# Only the skill, or only the MCP auth
curl -fsSL https://agentkey.app/install.sh | bash -s -- --skip-mcp
curl -fsSL https://agentkey.app/install.sh | bash -s -- --skip-skill
```

PowerShell equivalents: `-Yes`, `-ListAgents`, `-Only`, `-AllAgents`, `-SkipMcp`, `-SkipSkill`.

**Manual two-step install** (if you'd rather run the two underlying commands yourself, or the one-line installer can't reach your machine):

```bash
# 1. Install the skill into every detected agent
npx skills add chainbase-labs/agentkey

# 2. Authenticate and register the MCP server
npx -y @agentkey/cli --auth-login
```

**Headless / SSH / Docker?** The auth step always tries to open a browser **and** prints the URL — so on a machine without a usable display, just copy the printed URL to any device with a browser to finish auth. Prefer typing the key manually? `npx -y @agentkey/cli --setup` opens an interactive wizard instead.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>My agent isn't on the auto-configured list — how do I set it up manually?</b></summary>

MCP auto-configuration covers **Claude Code**, **Claude Desktop**, and **Cursor**. For **Codex / OpenCode / Gemini CLI / Hermes / Manus** (or Linux Claude Desktop), the skill still installs automatically — but you'll need to paste this MCP snippet into the agent's own config (path varies per agent):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agentkey": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://api.agentkey.app/v1/mcp",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer ak_..." }
    }
  }
}
```

Then restart the agent. The skill's first-run activation will also walk you through this.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I self-host or develop against this?</b></summary>

**Install from a local checkout:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chainbase-labs/agentkey.git
cd agentkey

# 1. Install your working tree into every detected agent
npx skills add .

# 2. Register the MCP server (if you haven't already)
npx -y @agentkey/cli --auth-login
```

`npx skills add .` accepts a local path (or a `file://` URL) — run it again after each edit to `skills/agentkey/SKILL.md`. The MCP step only needs to run once per machine.

**Iterating on the MCP server itself?** The server lives at `AgentKey-Server/` (Go) and exposes the MCP endpoint at `/v1/mcp`. Run a local server (`make run`) and point your MCP config at `http://localhost:8081/v1/mcp` to test changes end-to-end.

**Claude Code plugin mode** — install straight from the marketplace. The plugin prompts you for your AgentKey API key on enable and wires the MCP server for you, so there's **no second `@agentkey/cli` step**:

```bash
# Public install
claude plugin marketplace add chainbase-labs/agentkey
claude plugin install agentkey@agentkey

# …or from a local checkout, for development
claude plugin marketplace add /absolute/path/to/agentkey
claude plugin install agentkey@agentkey
```

On enable, Claude Code prompts for `AGENTKEY_API_KEY` (stored in your OS keychain) and injects it into the plugin's `.mcp.json` via `${user_config.AGENTKEY_API_KEY}`. Reload a local checkout with `claude plugin update agentkey` after edits. Day-to-day skill iteration is still fastest via the skills-CLI path; the plugin path is the one-step option for Claude Code users.

**Codex plugin mode** — install from the marketplace bundled in this repo. Auth is OAuth (browser sign-in on install), so there's **no API key to paste and no second `@agentkey/cli` step**:

```bash
# Public install
codex plugin marketplace add chainbase-labs/agentkey
# then run /plugins inside Codex and install AgentKey,
# or: codex plugin install agentkey@agentkey
```

The plugin manifest lives in `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`; it bundles the same skill plus a remote-HTTP MCP entry (`.codex-plugin/mcp.json`) that authenticates against `https://api.agentkey.app/v1/mcp` via MCP OAuth (RFC 9728 discovery). Sign in with your AgentKey account when Codex prompts you.

**Kimi Code plugin mode** — install the repo directly from Kimi Code. The manifest bundles the skill and an inline remote-HTTP MCP entry, so there is **no API key to paste and no second `@agentkey/cli` step**:

```text
# Public install
/plugins install https://github.com/chainbase-labs/agentkey

# Or install a local checkout for development
/plugins install /absolute/path/to/agentkey
```

Kimi shows `Run /new or /reload to apply plugin changes.` after installation. Run `/reload`; when Kimi reports that the plugin MCP server needs OAuth, run `/mcp-config login plugin-agentkey:agentkey` and approve the browser authorization. You can then ask your original AgentKey question.

Kimi copies local plugins into its managed plugin directory. Re-run `/plugins install /absolute/path/to/agentkey` after editing the checkout, then run `/reload` again.

If you previously worked around an older AgentKey plugin by adding a user-global `agentkey` entry through `/mcp-config`, remove that old entry once with `/mcp-config remove agentkey` before reloading. The plugin now owns its namespaced MCP entry; keeping both would create duplicate tools and authentication attempts.

**Cursor plugin mode** — install AgentKey from the Cursor Marketplace after the listing is published. The Cursor-native manifest at `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` bundles the same Skill and an inline remote-HTTP MCP entry, so there is **no API key to paste and no second `@agentkey/cli` step**. When Cursor prompts for MCP authentication, approve the AgentKey browser sign-in.

For a Cursor Team Marketplace, import this repository URL directly. `.cursor-plugin/marketplace.json` maps AgentKey to the real repository-local plugin folder at `./plugins/agentkey`; Cursor's marketplace loader does not install external-source entries. Team and Enterprise admins manage automatic or manual re-indexing from the web Dashboard. Personal GitHub imports in the Cursor IDE do not expose the same manual **Refresh** control and may continue to use an indexed commit.

> **Maintainers — `plugins/agentkey/` is generated.** The only source files are `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` and `skills/agentkey/`. Never edit the nested manifest or Skill copy directly. `./scripts/sync-cursor-marketplace-plugin.sh` copies both into `plugins/agentkey/` (excluding `version.txt`, which is not needed in the Cursor distribution package). CI runs the generator on macOS and Linux and fails if it changes any tracked file, with the exact command needed to repair the drift. CI intentionally does not commit generated files: after a failure, run the command locally and commit the resulting `plugins/agentkey/` diff with the source change.

For the public Cursor Marketplace, submit the public repository URL at [cursor.com/marketplace/publish](https://cursor.com/marketplace/publish). Before submitting, test the plugin in the current Cursor release and confirm that both the `agentkey` Skill and MCP server load successfully after OAuth. Both manifests follow the [Cursor plugin reference](https://cursor.com/docs/reference/plugins); keep plugin component paths relative to the plugin root.

**Gemini CLI extension mode** — install the repository as an extension. The root `gemini-extension.json` bundles the existing AgentKey skill and the remote Streamable HTTP MCP server, so there is **no API key to paste and no second `@agentkey/cli` step**:

```bash
# Public install
gemini extensions install https://github.com/chainbase-labs/agentkey

# Or link a local checkout for development
gemini extensions link /absolute/path/to/agentkey
```

Restart Gemini CLI after installing or linking. If the MCP server requires authentication, run `/mcp auth agentkey` and approve the browser authorization; Gemini then stores and refreshes the OAuth tokens. Use `/mcp reload` after changing the server configuration.

**Antigravity 2.0 / Antigravity CLI plugin mode** — both runtimes use the root `plugin.json`, `mcp_config.json`, and existing `skills/` directory. The MCP entry uses Antigravity's `serverUrl` schema and automatic OAuth discovery, so there is **no API key to paste and no second `@agentkey/cli` step**.

For Antigravity 2.0, place the repository at workspace scope or global scope, then restart Antigravity:

```bash
# Workspace scope
git clone https://github.com/chainbase-labs/agentkey.git /path/to/workspace/.agents/plugins/agentkey

# Or global scope
git clone https://github.com/chainbase-labs/agentkey.git ~/.gemini/config/plugins/agentkey
```

For Antigravity CLI, install a local checkout and verify it is registered:

```bash
agy plugin install /absolute/path/to/agentkey
agy plugin list
```

Antigravity 2.0 exposes OAuth through **Settings → Customizations → Authenticate**. In Antigravity CLI, open `/mcp` to inspect or reload the server and follow the authentication prompt when it first connects.

**Release a new version (maintainers):** releases are cut automatically by [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please). Merging a PR with a `feat:` or `fix:` title opens a Release PR that bumps `skills/agentkey/version.txt`, the four client plugin manifests plus the Cursor Team Marketplace manifest copy, `gemini-extension.json`, and `CHANGELOG.md`. The Antigravity schema has no `version` field, so its root `plugin.json` is not part of version syncing. CI regenerates the nested Cursor package and rejects the PR if the committed package is stale; run `scripts/sync-cursor-marketplace-plugin.sh` locally and commit its output to fix the check. Merging the Release PR creates the tag + GitHub Release + uploads the `agentkey.skill` asset.
